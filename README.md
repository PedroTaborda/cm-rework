# Python API for Carris Metropolitana Bus Lines

This is a Python API for Carris Metropolitana Bus Lines. It uses the API used by the [Carris Metropolitana website](https://www.carrismetropolitana.pt/horarios/). This project is not affiliated with Carris Metropolitana.

The largest benefit of this API is the ability to get the next bus times for a given bus stop, for all bus lines that pass through it. This is not possible with the Carris Metropolitana website, which only shows the next bus times for a given bus line and bus stop.


## Language

Both the code comments and the documentation are in English. The code used by Carris Metropolitana mixes English and Portuguese, leading to inconsistent naming, so English was chosen to avoid confusion and to match that of the dependencies.
