# Python API for Carris Metropolitana Bus Lines

This is a Python API for Carris Metropolitana Bus Lines. It uses the API used by the [Carris Metropolitana website](https://www.carrismetropolitana.pt/horarios/). This project is not affiliated with Carris Metropolitana.

The largest benefit of this API is the ability to get the next bus times for a given bus stop, for all bus lines that pass through it. This is not possible with the Carris Metropolitana website, which only shows the next bus times for a given bus line and bus stop.
